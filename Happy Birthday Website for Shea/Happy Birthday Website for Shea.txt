	<p class="center"> 
YOU'RE 18 NOW HOOORAAAYYY!!!! So because I unfortunately won't be able to see you, I have decided to try creating you a digital birthday card, I know this may seem a little simple but I had a little help from someone (Google.. and some Ai...). However I still hope you like this and appreciate it, but if you don't theeeen biggest airball of the century ig.

(PS: I'm not sure if what I wrote is appropriate for a birthday card, but I hope you love it either way)

I'm so happy for you because it's you're 18th birthday, I'm really grateful for you not only as my girlfriend, but also being one of my best friends in my life &#129505;. I know we have had our ups and downs together and almost lost touch because of me... &#128532; but in the end it's hard to put into words just how much I appreciate having you in my life and us circling back to being more that just friends. If I weren't able to be by your side as I am right now, I would have  realized what a mistake that I had made by losing you as someone in my life, because you are someone who is fun to be around, radiates happiness when they are enjoying something, outgoing with wanting to meet new people and nonchalant (&#128511; to a degree...) which I believe has changed me for the better. I admire you in so many ways and I'm glad I'm someone you value on your birthday :). I'll once again never be able to express how grateful that I am to be apart of your life and how happy I am right now for you that it's your birthday. I hope you continue working hard and reach all the goals you have in place for yourself &#128548; because you deserve everything as you are an amazing person who deserves nothing but the best. I wish for you to have a great birthday party &#128591; and for many more birthday celebrations to come where we can be together &#128536;.	</p class="indent">

	<p class="indent">
I wish you an absolutely, gargantuan, terrific, amazing birthday once again, and I hope for your good health and safety being proper adult now (you we're already one tbh), but still once again I wish you the best of luck for the new challenges you may face.

I LOVEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE &#129505; &#129505; &#129505; YOU SO MUCH &#129505; &#129505; &#129505;!
