Happy Valentines Day!!! I'm writing little poem (i think) this to tell you how muuuuuuuuch I LOVE YOUUU. 

Shea, 

I miss you so much and I wish I could be by your side. I'm so lucky a guy like me can get to call you mine. Your smile when you're happy fills me with nothing but joy. Your eyes whenever we are talking bring comfort and love making them something I adore. Your laughter is contagious and drowns out all other noise. Your nonchalant side is nice, but your chalant side is simply too cute making it something I can't ignore. I hope you hold me accountable for every action you don't like. Because meeting someone in this world as perfect as you isn't something that happens twice. Evolving our friendship into something new, I'm so glad to be able to love someone like you. Even if I don't show it everyday, Know that I love you in every single way.

Love, Ivan.
